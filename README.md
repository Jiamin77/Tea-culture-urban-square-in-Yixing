# Tea-culture-urban-square-in-Yixing

As the urban center progressively shifts toward emerging districts, a key challenge in shaping cultural public spaces for a “new city center” lies in how local cultural lineage can be sustained and reinterpreted in the new area, while district vitality is enhanced through plaza renewal and redesign. 

This project uses an urban square as the spatial carrier to develop a culturally themed plaza oriented to the new city center. Building on a systematic analysis of the city’s historical context, existing site conditions, and user needs, the design adopts tea culture as the narrative thread to restructure pedestrian circulation and spatial sequences, refine functional zoning and activity nodes, and establish distinctive landmarks, thereby strengthening cultural expression and everyday place vitality.
